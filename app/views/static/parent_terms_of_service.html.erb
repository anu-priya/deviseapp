				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">a. Generally.</p>

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Famtivity in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Famtivity agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Famtivity are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">Notwithstanding subsection Generally.

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">c. Arbitrator.</p>

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">Any arbitration between you and Famtivity will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Famtivity.</p>
		
				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">d. Notice; Process.</p>

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Famtivity&rsquo;s address for Notice is: 2461 S. Larkey Ln., Walnut Creek, CA 94597. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Famtivity may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Famtivity shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Famtivity shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by Famtivity in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator&rsquo;s award.</p>		
		
				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">e. Fees.</p>

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Famtivity will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Famtivity for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.</p>		
		
				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">f. No Class Actions.</p>

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">YOU AND Famtivity AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Famtivity agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>		

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">g. Modifications.</p>

				<p class="fnt13 line_spaceing content_p para_indent_first">In the event that Famtivity makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Famtivity&rsquo;s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Famtivity&rsquo;s address for Notice, in which case your account with Famtivity shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.</p>
