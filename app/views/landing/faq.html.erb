						</div>					
					</div>
					<div class="head">

					<div class="head">
						<div>Can I apply Discount Dollars to activities that aren&#39;t being sold directly through Famtivity?</div>
						<div class="para"><p>Not at this time. However, if you invite your desired provider to join Famtivity and they sign-up for the sell-through plan, then you get a $25 credit and can then apply your Discount Dollars towards their activities.</p>
